\section{Markov Random Fields}
\label{sec:mrf}
Markov Random Fields (MRF) are a basic model for obtaining structured probability distributions that factorize according to a graph.
Finding the most probable configuration is called maximum-a-posteriori inference or MAP-MRF for short.
Here we consider only discrete MRFs, i.e.\ random variables of the MRF can only take a finite number of values.
MAP-MRF for discrete MRFs can be cast as an ILP~\cite{werner2007linear}.


\begin{definition}[MRF]
    \label{def:mrf}
Let an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, label spaces $\mathcal{L}_v = \{1,\ldots, \abs{\mathcal{L}_v}\}$ for each variable $v \in V$ and $\mathcal{L} = \prod_{v \in V} \mathcal{L}_v$ and 
unary potentials $\phi_v : \mathcal{L}_v \rightarrow \R$, $v \in V$ as well as pairwise potentials
$\phi_{uv} : \mathcal{L}_u \times \mathcal{L}_v \rightarrow \R$, $uv \in E$ be given.
The probability distribution defined by an MRF $(V,E,\mathcal{L},\phi)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}_{\phi}(x) = \frac{\prod_{v \in V} \phi_v(x_v) \cdot \prod_{uv \in E} \phi_{uv}(x_u,x_v)}{ \underbrace{\sum_{x \in \mathcal{L}} \prod_{v \in V} \phi_v(x_v) \cdot \prod_{uv \in E} \phi_{uv}(x_u,x_v)}_{ := Z } } \,.
\end{equation}
The normalization constant $Z$ is called the partition function.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[MAP]
The maximum-a-posteriori element is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:map-mrf}
x^* \in \argmax_{x \in \mathcal{L}} \mathbb{P}(x)\,.
\end{equation}
After taking negative logarithms $\theta_v = - \log(\phi_v)$ $\forall v \in V$ and $\theta_{uv} = -\log(\phi_{uv})$ $\forall uv \in E$ the MAP problem~\eqref{eq:map-mrf} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\min_{x \in \mathcal{L}} \theta(x) = \sum_{v \in V} \theta_v(x_v) + \sum_{uv \in E} \theta_{uv}(x_u,x_v) \,.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\subsection{File Format}
\label{sec:mrf-file-format}
We use an extension of the UAI file format~\url{https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/project/PASCAL/fileFormat.php}.

{
\small
\begin{fileformat}
MARKOV
(*$\abs{V}$*)
(*$\abs{\mathcal{L}_1}$*) ... (*$\abs{\mathcal{L}_{\abs{V}}}$*) 
(*$\abs{V} + \abs{E}$*)
1 1
.
.
.
1 (*$\abs{V}$*) 
2 (*$i_1$*) (*$j_1$*) 
.
.

2 (*$i_{\abs{E}}$*) (*$j_{\abs{E}}$*) 

(*$\abs{\mathcal{L}_1}$*) 
(*$\theta_1(1)$*) ... (*$\theta_1(\abs{\mathcal{L}_1})$*)
.
.

(*$\abs{\mathcal{L}_{\abs{V}}}$*)
(*$\theta_{\abs{V}}(1)$*) ... (*$\theta_{\abs{V}}(\abs{\mathcal{L}_{\abs{V}}})$*)

(*$\abs{\mathcal{L}_{i_1}} \cdot \abs{\mathcal{L}_{j_1}} $*) 
(*$\theta_{i_1 j_1}(1,1)$*) (*$\theta_{i_1 j_1}(1,2)$*) ... (*$\theta_{i_1 j_1}(\abs{\mathcal{L}_{i_1}}, \abs{\mathcal{L}_{j_1}})$*)
.

(*$\abs{\mathcal{L}_{i_{\abs{E}}}} \cdot \abs{\mathcal{L}_{j_{\abs{E}}}} $*) 
(*$\theta_{i_{\abs{E}} j_{\abs{E}}}(1,1)$*) ... (*$\theta_{i_{\abs{E}} j_{\abs{E}}}(\abs{\mathcal{L}_{i_{\abs{E}}}}, \abs{\mathcal{L}_{j_{\abs{E}}}})$*)
\end{fileformat}
}
The file is structured as follows:
First comes the preamble (MARKOV, line 1),
then the number of variables ($\abs{V}$, line 2),
then the number of labels for each variable in order,
then the number of unary and pairwise potentials.
Next come the index lines:
for each unary and pairwise potential the number of nodes (1 for variables, 2 for edges) followed by the variable indices.
Last come function tables in the order given by the index lines.
Each function table gives the number of entries in the function table $\abs{\mathcal{L}_i}$ for variables $i$ and $\abs{\mathcal{L}_i} \cdot \abs{\mathcal{L}_j}$ for edge $ij$ followed by the values of the corresponding potentials $\theta_i$ or $\theta_{ij}$ respectively.

Additionally we provide LP-files for all datasets using the local polytope relaxation~\cite{werner2007linear} for general pairwise potentials and a compactified one equivalent to the local polytope for Potts potentials.

\subsection{Datasets}
The below datasets object-seg, color-seg, color-seg-n4, color-seg-n8 and protein-folding are part of the OpenGM benchmark~\cite{kappes2015comparative}.
These datasets are additionally given in the OpenGM hdf5 format.

\subsubsection[object-seg]{object-seg\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/716a0a8621f44d0ba9be/?dl=1}}}

\subsubsection[color-seg-n8]{color-seg-n8\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/0077922f8e054fee8860/?dl=1}}}
Image segmentation of up to 76800 nodes on a 8-neighborhood with up to 12 labels. 
Pairwise potentials are of Potts type.
Instances are originally from~\cite{lellmann2011continuous}.

\subsubsection[protein-folding]{protein-folding\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/927e7cfa31fa4cd9bcd4/?dl=1}}}
29 instances of moderate size with sparse and full connectivity and pairwise potentials of general type.
Instances are originally from~\cite{jaimovich2006towards,elidan2011probabilistic} for solving the protein folding problem.

\subsubsection[Global 6D Object Pose Estimation]{Global 6D Object Pose Estimation\footnote{\url{https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/399de399aa1146c29556/?dl=1}}}

Instances are cropped versions of those from~\cite{michel2017global} for the 6D object pose estimation problem.
The crops are given by masks covering the object of interest and reduce problem size.
We do not provide ILP-files in the format of Section~\ref{sec:ilp-file-format} due to the large size of the resulting encoding.
